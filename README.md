## Adding your profile

You can add / update your personal profile by creating a Pull Request to this repo:

1. Create a new JSON file in the [people](data/people/) directory, and name it as your GitHub username.  
   e.g. If you GitHub user is MichalPorag, `MichalPorag.json`.

   The JSON file should look something like:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "השם שלך",
     "github": "Your GitHub Username (not link, just the username)",
     "facebook": "Link to your Facebook Profile (optional)",
     "twitter": "Link to your Twitter Profile (optional)",
     "linkedin": "Link to your LinkedIn page (optional)",
     "website": "Link to your personal blog / website (optional)",
     "description": "פסקה או שתיים על עצמך: רקע מקצועי, עבודה, תחביבים ומה שחשוב לך שהחברים בקבוצה ידעו"
   }
   ```

   The `name`, `github`, and `description` fields are required and **need to be in Hebrew**.  
   All the other fields are optional.

   Use the `description` field to introduce yourself: technologies that you love, hobbies, fun-facts,
   and anything that you are passionate about. Are you an architect? Do you speak Chinese? Studied amusement park
   and roller coaster engineering? This is the place to brag!

2. By default, we'll use your GitHub photo. If you don't have a GitHub profile photo,
   or want to use a different one, add it under [public/images/people](public/images/people) in jpeg format.
   Use your GitHub username for the image, e.g. `MichalPorag.jpg`.

   Then, add `"customImage": true` to your profile JSON that you created in the previous step.

3. Create a pull request with new files.
