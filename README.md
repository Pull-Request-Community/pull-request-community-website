## Adding your profile

### What to write?

First of all, please write in Hebrew. Share things that will help other people know what makes
you unique: hobbies, talents, fun-facts, technologies that you love.

Here are some good description example:

<✅✅✅>

מפתח פול-סטאק ב4 שנים האחרונות ואחד המנהלים בקהילה,
אוהב מאד ללמוד ולפתח אפליקציות WEB ותמיד לעזור לאנשים בתחום בכל דרך שהיא.
בזמני הפנוי אוהב לתופף, להקליט ולהופיע עם הלהקה שלי

</✅✅✅>

And these are examples of things that don't really add value, they may sound "smart" but when
other people read it, it doesn't help them connect with you:

<🚫🚫🚫>

אוהב לקודד ולישון ...

</🚫🚫🚫>

### The technical stuff

You can add / update your personal profile by creating a Pull Request to this repo:

1. Create a new JSON file in the [people](people/) directory, and name it as your GitHub username.  
   e.g. If you GitHub user is MichalPorag, `MichalPorag.json`.

   The JSON file should look something like:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "השם שלך",
     "github": "Your GitHub Username (not link, just the username)",
     "facebook": "Link to your Facebook Profile (optional)",
     "twitter": "Link to your Twitter Profile (optional)",
     "linkedin": "Link to your LinkedIn page (optional)",
     "website": "Link to your personal blog / website (optional)",
     "description": "פסקה או שתיים על עצמך: רקע מקצועי, עבודה, תחביבים ומה שחשוב לך שהחברים בקבוצה ידעו"
   }
   ```

   The `name`, `github`, and `description` fields are required and **need to be in Hebrew**.  
   All the other fields are optional.

   Use the `description` field to introduce yourself: technologies that you love, hobbies, fun-facts,
   and anything that you are passionate about. Are you an architect? Do you speak Chinese? Studied amusement park
   and roller coaster engineering? This is the place to brag!

2. By default, we'll use your GitHub photo. If you don't have a GitHub profile photo,
   or want to use a different one, add it under [public/images/people](public/images/people) in jpeg format.
   Use your GitHub username for the image, e.g. `MichalPorag.jpg`.

   Then, add `"customImage": true` to your profile JSON that you created in the previous step.

3. Create a pull request with new files.
